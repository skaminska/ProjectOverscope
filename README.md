# Project Overscope - 3D RPG game prototype

Shortcut to code folder: https://github.com/skaminska/ProjectOverscope/tree/master/Assets/ProjectOverscope/Scripts

IN DEVELOPMENT

An RPG game currently contains systems (for now all are just the prototype versions):
- inventory
- equipment
- quests
- skills
- NPC

This is my biggest project so far. I try not to use any tutorials while developing this project so all systems are created by me from scratch based on my knowledge and unity documentation or UnityForum/StackOverflow (usually when I meet some issues).
